# Sequence Analysis Toolkit
The Sequence Analysis Toolkit is a tool designed for biochemists to make sequence analysis quick and easy. Large amounts of information can be extracted from a biological sequence quickly with the intuitive visual interface.

## Current state
The Sequence Analysis Toolkit is currently under development. The front end is mostly complete and the back end, powered by the flask web framework for python, can now be extended to add new functions. The backend currently supports Blast protein searches and DNA restriction enzyme digests, but will in future support a range of sequence analysis tools including database searches and simple sequence processing techniques. Several bugfixes are needed on the frontend and I will implement a data visualiser to analyse data obtained and produce high quality customisable figures. Where available I will use BioJS components to speed up development of the visualiser and when none are available I will implement my own which I might contribute to the BioJS project.
